    <!-- async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
    scripts with an async attribute will execute as soon as the download is complete. This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order.
    scripts with a defer attribute will load in the order they are in and will only execute once everything has finished loading.
    If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async.
    If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want the browser to execute them. -->
